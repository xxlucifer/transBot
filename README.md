# TransBot
This is a simple chatbot powered by RASA 3.x
You can check for account balance and transaction history of the users that are in the database.(The database is a simple dictionary passed inside the actions.py file.)
Here is a simple step-by-step instruction to run the TransBot:
1. Open up your terminal and navigate inside the folder transBot.[Make sure that you have your virtual environment set up first, or this won't work!]
2. Enter the command 'rasa shell'. The chatbot will start, but to enable the functionality of the chatbot, you'll need to run the rasa actions server.
3. Open up another terminal and navigate to your transbot folder.
4. Enter the command 'rasa run actions'.
5. Everything is set up. Now you can enjoy TransBot. Thank you!
